    "#### Understanding Buyer Preferences:\n",
    " - Buyers will input their requirements and preferences, such as location, property type, budget, amenities, and lifestyle choices.\n",
    "\n",
    " - The application uses LLMs to interpret these inputs in natural language, understanding nuanced requests beyond basic filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrating with a Vector Database:\n",
    " - Connect \"HomeMatch\" with a vector database, where all available property listings are stored.\n",
    " \n",
    " - Utilize vector embeddings to match properties with buyer preferences, focusing on aspects like neighborhood vibes, architectural styles, and proximity to specific amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Personalized Listing Description Generation:\n",
    "- For each matched listing, use an LLM to rewrite the description in a way that highlights aspects most relevant to the buyer‚Äôs preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure personalization emphasizes characteristics appealing to the buyer without altering factual information about the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Listing Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
